Cooking the Pierogi
-------------------

Bring a large pot of water to boil.  Drop in about eight pierogies in the boiling water.  Cook for 2-3 minutes.  When they float up to the top, they should be done.  Take them out of the water with the slotted spoon and drain in the colander.  If you are making a lot of pierogi, you will want to keep that pot of water on low heat so you can bring it quickly to a boil when you need to cook another batch of pierogi.  Change the water if you are switching to a different type of filling.

Frying the Pierogi
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After boiling, put them in a frying pan or electric griddle with some butter and fry them until they are lightly browned.

Saving the Pierogi for Tomorrow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To store the pierogi for a short while, layer them in a plastic container.  Brush the bottom of the container with melted butter and then put a thin layer of melted butter on the top of each **boiled** pierogi.  Separate each layer with plastic wrap.  This will make it easier to unstick

Freezing the Pierogi
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to save some pierogi for later, line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and place the **uncooked** pierogi on them.  Put in the freezer for several hours until hard enough to throw all of them in a plastic bag.
